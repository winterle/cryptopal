My attempt at the cryptopal challenges: https://cryptopals.com/
This is my first time writing ruby code, so it's defenitely not written
in a clean style or efficiently in any way.
Credit to technion, who completed all of the challenges in ruby,
especially in the first and parts of the second set i took a peek at
his code (and you will probably find some very similar functions to his in my code)

i'll continue to work on the sets as i have time/motivation
